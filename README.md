# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website** built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The website showcases my skills, projects, and background as a developer, presented in a clean, responsive design.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Stack:** Built with React + Vite for fast development and hot reloading.  
- **Responsive Design:** Fully mobile-friendly using Tailwind CSS.  
- **Deployed on GitHub Pages:** Automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions.  
- **AI-Assisted Development:** Most of the code structure, components, and deployment automation were generated using **AI tools**, significantly reducing the overall development time while maintaining quality and readability.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Build Tool:** Vite  
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (with CI/CD workflow)  
- **Package Manager:** npm  

## 🧩 Local Development

Clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hrushitha12/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173/**.

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch.  
The live site can be viewed at:  
👉 [https://hrushitha12.github.io/Portfolio/](https://hrushitha12.github.io/Portfolio/)

Deployment is handled by a GitHub Actions workflow defined in:
```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

## 💡 AI Acknowledgment

All core sections (project structure, Vite configuration, Tailwind setup, and GitHub Pages workflow) were generated and refined using **AI assistance**.  
This approach drastically reduced the time required to scaffold, debug, and deploy the entire website — turning what would normally take hours into minutes.
